question 1:
are we allowed to use enum sets and enum maps, I wanted to use them because they are more efficient than hashsets and hashmaps and they put the enums
we currently have to use which could help catch any errors before compilation

question 2:
the .class keyword is used in the syntax of enum sets and maps, is that allowed? (it is technically a property which we have covered)

question 3:
are my equals methods looking good?

question 5:
is the solution to the added types, a singleton with predefined patterns

question 4:
should the enum respond with the boolean or the types class
