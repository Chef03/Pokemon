This repository contains a java project for **assignment 2** (OOP) of the SEM program

The most recent version of this repo contains a graphical version of the task which I think is really cool to try out in order to know about ways 
your existing logic can be used in different cases, you're not just limited by the console, the same logic that was used to pass this assignment can be 
applied with awesome stuff like art to create graphical interfaces and even games!

That being said, the library being used to achieve this here is Java Swing which is really outdated in 2022, and there is no doubt that the code here can be greatly 
improved as I think I didnt make the optimal choices performance wise or design wise but the goal was to put something together quickly just to show how the logic can be implemented in GUIs, 
<ins>there's lots of place for improvement</ins> for this repo, maybe you could attempt to add or fix code to improve it.

The concepts being used here are fairly simple especially if you get the hang of the java swing library
